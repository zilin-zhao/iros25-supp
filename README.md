This repository serves as the supplementary material repository for our paper submitted to IROS 2025. It is intended to elaborate on matters that could not be included in the paper due to space limitations, providing brief demos, additional images, more detailed descriptions, and so on. The code will be uploaded opon the acceptance of the paper.

## abstract
Path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is crucial in remote sensing and information collection. As task scales expand, the cooperative deployment of multiple UAVs significantly improves information collection efficiency. However, collaborative communication and decision-making for multiple UAVs remain major challenges in path planning, especially in noisy environments. To efficiently accomplish complex information collection tasks in 3D space and address robust communication issues, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for UAV path planning based on the Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA) algorithm. The framework incorporates an attention mechanism-based UAV communication protocol and training-deployment system, significantly enhancing robust communication and individual decision-making capabilities under noisy conditions. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing algorithms in terms of path planning efficiency and robustness, especially under noise environments.
